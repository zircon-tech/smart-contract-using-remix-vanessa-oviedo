Test Network: I used a connection to my Metamask provider. The network selected was Ropsten. 

Contract was deployed at : https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x4e1b0353157700252f95b5c20d990f4a3ba71760#readContract . I have decompiled the deployed contract so you can see the full code and interact with it.
